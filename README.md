This is my Professional Portfolio. It is incomplete but I'm uploading what I have done so far. I know this Portfolio hasn't matched the acceptance criteria, but I'm hoping with a bit more time I can re-submit.

I did a wireframe on paper to see how I was going to layout my site. That definitley assisted me in the beginning. It was the CSS positioning of certain elements that was challenging.
